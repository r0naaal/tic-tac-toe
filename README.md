# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Console Game

This project started as a simple school assignment, but I decided to step it up and make it the best one in the class! It’s a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game you can play in your terminal, either against a friend or a really tough AI opponent.

The AI is not a real neural network or anything super advanced, but it’s smart enough to almost never lose (seriously, it’s really hard to beat—probably wins or draws 99% of the time). Working on this was a cool intro to how AI logic works, and it opened my eyes to learning more about AI and neural networks in the future.

## Features

- Play against another person or the AI
- The AI is almost unbeatable!
- Keeps track of scores between games
- Fun animated text output

## How to Play

1. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```sh
   java -cp bin TicTacToe
   ```

Thanks for checking it out! If you have ideas or want to make the AI even smarter, feel free to fork or suggest
